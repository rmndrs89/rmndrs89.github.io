## Welcome!

::: {.callout-tip}
I am currently rebuilding my personal website using Quarto, so you won't see that much here yet.

I am a **biomedical engineer** with expertise in **digital signal processing** and **machine learning**. 

My core experience involves the analysis of complex, multimodal longitudinal datasets to understand dynamic physiological and health processes. 

A crucial part of my work is communicating technical findings effectively: I am adept at translating sophisticated results for a diverse audience, ensuring clarity and relevance whether I'm speaking with a fellow engineer or a practicing clinician.
